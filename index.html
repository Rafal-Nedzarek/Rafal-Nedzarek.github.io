        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><b>2012</b> – finished my higher education (MA in English Studies,
        MA in International Relations and Security) with flying colors
        and began work as freelance translator.</p>
        <p><b>2014</b> – took a few Python courses on Coursera (starting with 
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?">Python for Everybody</a>)
        and was able to use the knowledge to automate simple tasks in my new office job as Language Lead.
        There, I gained my first experience with <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>, using it to coordinate linguistic QA.</p>
        <p><b>2017</b> – worked as Technical Specialist at a translation company. I administered the
        <a href="https://www.xtrf.eu/">XTRF system</a> and served as 1st line internal support
        for stakeholders at various levels of technical knowledge.
        While handling various file formats in the <a href="https://www.memoq.com/en/">MemoQ CAT tool</a>,
        I gained basic XML and HTML knowledge. I followed that up with basic CSS and JavaScript training at
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> to better understand how front-end works.</p>
        <p><b>2018</b> – got hired as Software Support Engineer at a fintech company.
        I expanded my SQL knowledge and aquired some Oracle DB troubleshooting skills.
        Additionally, I gained first-hand experience of working as part of an agile development team
        while supporting business clients via e-mail, chat and Jira.
        I also passed the <a href="https://www.istqb.org/certification-path-root/foundation-level/foundation-level-in-a-nutshell.html">
        ISTQB Foundation Level exam</a>.</p>
        <p><b>2019</b> – after relocating to Dublin, Ireland I am looking for 
        an IT job that would utilize and develop my hard-earned skills.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>My biggest struggle over the years has been to keep my programming a sustained effort.
        Having to juggle full-time work at the office with steady freelance translation contracts,
        I often had to postpone my learning to a later date.</p>
        <p>I decided I would need to work on personal projects
        – not only to showcase my skills but to keep my focus.
        To finally connect various technologies I had learnt, I chose the Django framework. 
        I started with the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/">
        Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp</a> course on Udemy
        and quickly supplemented it with official Django documentation, Stack Overflow and other sources.</p>
        <p>After several weeks of learning and experimenting, I have deployed 
        <strong><a href="https://employees-demo-heroku.herokuapp.com/employees/">my first Django app</a></strong> to Heroku. 
        Visitors can register, login, and perform CRUD operations on tables stored in a Heroku Postgres database. 
        The app’s code can be found on <strong><a href="https://github.com/Rafal-Nedzarek/">my GitHub profile page</a></strong>.</p>
