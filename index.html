          a little bit about myself and a showcase of my projects. Of course,
          this page is also part of my portfolio – I have put in extra effort

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><b>2012</b> – finished my higher education (MA in English Studies,
        MA in International Relations and Security) with flying colors
        and began work as freelance translator.</p>
        <p><b>2014</b> – took a few Python courses on Coursera (starting with 
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?">Python for Everybody</a>)
        and was able to use the knowledge to automate simple tasks in my new office job as Language Lead.
        There, I gained my first experience with Jira, using it to coordinate linguistic QA.</p>
        <p><b>2017</b> – became a Technical Specialist at a translation company. I administered the
        <a href="https://www.xtrf.eu/">XTRF system</a> and served as 1st line internal support
        for stakeholders at various levels of technical knowledge.
        While handling various file formats in the <a href="https://www.memoq.com/en/">MemoQ CAT tool</a>,
        I gained basic XML and HTML knowledge. I followed that up with basic CSS and JavaScript training at
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> to better understand how the front-end works.
        Around that time I was convinced that working in IT was within my reach.</p>
        <p><b>2018</b> – got hired as Software Support Engineer at a fintech company.
        I expanded my SQL knowledge and gained some Oracle DB troubleshooting skills.
        Additionally, I gained first-hand experience of working as part of an agile development team
        while supporting business clients via e-mail and chat.
        I also passed the <a href="https://www.istqb.org/certification-path-root/foundation-level/foundation-level-in-a-nutshell.html">
        ISTQB Foundation Level exam</a>.</p>
        <p><b>2019</b> – after relocating to Dublin, Ireland I am looking for 
        an IT job that would utilize and develop my hard-earned skills.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>My biggest struggle over the years has been to keep my programming a sustained effort.
        Having to juggle full-time work at the office with steady freelance translation contracts,
        I often had to postpone my learning to a later date.</p>
        <p>I decided I would need to work on personal projects
        – not only to showcase my skills but to keep my focus.
        To finally connect various technologies I had learnt, I chose the Django framework. 
        I started with the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/">
        Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp</a> course on Udemy
        and quickly supplemented it with official Django documentation, Stack Overflow and other sources.</p>
        <p>I used MySQL RDBMS with the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/">Employees Sample Database</a>
        and based my ORM models on the existing tables with the instpectdb utility.
        I built a simple application to query the Employees table and display related data from other tables.
        My chief focus was the views.py file, so the front-end will be left bare-bones for the time being.
        Finally, I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/">pycodestyle</a> to make my code more readable.</p>
        <p>Right now I run Django locally, using the built-in development server.
        I plan to host my app on Heroku or AWS in the near future.
        Until then, you can find some of the files on <a href="#">my GitHub page</a>.
        I will soon add a simple ModelForm to enable adding entries into some of the tables.
        I also plan to introduce some automated testing and to read more about the ORM to tweak my queries.
        Once I’m done with this project, I would like to refresh and broaden my JavaScript knowledge
        and delve into either Angular or React.</p>
